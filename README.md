E-commerce Capstone Project Assignment
Project Overview
In this capstone project, you will analyze an e-commerce marketplace's performance to help
the business understand their customer behavior, sales patterns, and develop predictive
models for future sales. This project will integrate all the key concepts you've learned
throughout the course, from data analysis to predictive modeling.
Dataset Information
You will work with the E-commerce Public Dataset. This rich dataset includes:
● Customer information
● Order details and status
● Product information
● Payment details
● Review ratings
● Geographic data
Phase 1: Understanding and Preparing Your Data (Part 1)
Part A: Initial Data Exploration
Your first task is to understand the structure and content of your dataset:
1. Data Loading and Overview
> Load each CSV file from the dataset
> Examine the structure of each table
> Create a data dictionary for your project
> Document the relationships between different tables
2. Data Quality Assessment
> Identify missing values in each column
> Check for duplicate entries
> Verify data types of each column
> Look for potential outliers
> Document any anomalies you find
Part B: Data Integration
Develop a strategy to combine relevant tables:
1. Planning Your Integration
> Decide which tables you need for your analysis
> Plan your join strategy
> Identify potential challenges in merging data
2. Creating Your Analytical Dataset
> Combine tables using appropriate joins
> Ensure no unintended data loss
> Verify the accuracy of your merged dataset
Phase 2: Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering (Part 2)
1. Data Cleaning Strategy
> Handle missing values with appropriate techniques
> Remove or handle duplicate entries
> Convert data types as needed
> Handle outliers appropriately
> Document all cleaning decisions
2. Feature Engineering
> Create time-based features from order dates
> Calculate customer-centric metrics
> Develop product-based features
> Create any additional relevant features
3. Data Validation
> Verify the integrity of your cleaned dataset
> Ensure all engineered features are correctly calculated
> Document any assumptions made
Phase 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (Part 3)
1. Temporal Analysis
> Analyze daily, weekly, and monthly sales patterns
> Identify seasonal trends
> Study delivery time patterns
> Examine payment patterns over time
2. Customer Analysis
> Analyze customer geographic distribution
> Study purchase frequency patterns
> Examine customer spending habits
> Analyze the impact of reviews on future purchases
3. Product Analysis
> Identify top-selling products and categories
> Analyze price distributions
> Study product category relationships
> Examine product return rates
Phase 4: Statistical Analysis and Modeling (Part 4)
1. Predictive Modeling
> Pick one prediction problem where you can use a regression technique to
predict (ex. Order value per customer , days to order etc). Document the
hypothesis etc.,
> Choose your target variable.
> Select appropriate features for modeling
> Split your data into training and testing sets
> Build and evaluate multiple linear regression models
> Document your model selection process
2. Model Evaluation
> Assess model assumptions
> Calculate and interpret key metrics (R², RMSE, MAE)
> Analyze feature importance
> Validate your model on test data
> Document model limitations
